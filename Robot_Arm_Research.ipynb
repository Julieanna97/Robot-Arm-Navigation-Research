    "A [Robotic arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_arm) is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar characteristics of a human arm. The purpose of the robot is to replace the human in difficult and harmful tasks e.g., Industrial production, processing and manufacturing roles. Any task in which extremely precise, fast and repeatable movements are required as well as to automate the process of doing the daily task that humans typically do.\n",
